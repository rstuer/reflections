Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

1.	Git is made for programmers that work on multiple files.
2.	Very often projects have more than one programmer working on the software
3.	Google Doc is not meant to work with more people
